# Agent Guidelines

## Scope
These instructions apply to the entire repository.

## Coding & Content Standards
- Keep the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript formatted with Prettier using the shared command in the Testing section.
- Favor semantic HTML elements and meaningful headings when editing markup.
- Keep asset paths relative and avoid introducing build tooling without updating this guide.

## Testing
- Before committing, run `npx prettier --check index.html assets/css/styles.css assets/js/main.js`.

## Documentation
- When the user asks for repository documentation updates, ensure the top-level README remains current with any new capabilities or workflows you add.
